# Culinary Companion - Revised CW1

**Module:** Mobile Computing  
**Student:** Ivaylo Donchev (idonch01)  


## This is my **revised and fully working version** of **Coursework 1 - Culinary Companion ** for the *Mobile Computing* module.

It includes:
- **Empty Views Activities** (no Compose)
- `DashboardActivity` as the launcher screen
- `RecipeDetailsActivity` for adding a new recipe
- `activity_dashboard.xml` layout matching the wireframe
- `recipe_item.xml` for RecyclerView item template
- `activity_recipe_details.xml` for the Add/Edit Recipe form
- Correct `AndroidManifest.xml` with the right launcher activity

The project has been **built and tested in Android Studio ** 

## How to use

1. **Download** the attached `CulinaryCompanion.zip`.
2. **Unzip** the folder.
3. Open **Android Studio** → `Open Project` → select the unzipped folder.
4. Click **Sync Gradle** if needed.
5. Click **Run ** — the app launches to the **Dashboard** screen.

## Wireframe consistency

This version matches the original wireframes for:
- **Dashboard Screen**
- **Add Recipe Screen**
- RecyclerView placeholder for displaying recipes

This version addresses **previous feedback**:
- Uses correct Views-only Activities
- Builds successfully
- Proper layout structure


## Notes

This version is for **Coursework 1 only**, covering project setup, activities, layouts, and wireframe compliance.  
Functionality such as RecyclerView population, database, and full CRUD operations will be implemented in **Coursework 2**.
